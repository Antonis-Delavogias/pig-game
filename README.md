# [pig-game]

**Project Goals:**

* Build a functioning Pig Dice Game using JavaScript.

* Practice DOM manipulation to update the game interface dynamically.

* Implement event listeners to respond to user interactions.

* Utilize variables, data types, and conditional statements for game logic.

# What I Learned:

* DOM Manipulation: Selecting and modifying HTML elements using document.querySelector, getElementById, and methods like .textContent and .classList.

* Variables and Data Types: Effectively storing and managing game data with variables (arrays, numbers) for scores, player turns, and dice rolls.

* Event Listeners: Reacting to user actions (button clicks) by attaching event listeners to elements and executing corresponding functions.

* Conditional Statements: Controlling game flow based on dice rolls and player actions using if, else statements to determine win conditions, player switching, and score updates.

* Functions: Organizing code into reusable functions for tasks like switching players, resetting the game state, and handling button clicks.

* Random Numbers: Generating random dice rolls using Math functions to simulate the game's core mechanic.

# Feel free to:

* Explore the code to see how JavaScript interacts with the HTML and CSS to create the game.

* Experiment with the game logic and styling!

* Ask any questions or share improvements for this Pig Dice Game implementation.
